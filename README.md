## Why KnowNote?

I really like the idea behind **Google NotebookLM**:
upload documents, build context, and reason over them with LLMs.

But I wanted a few things it doesn’t give me:

- Using my own **private or self-managed LLM APIs**
- Keeping **all data local**, without cloud lock-in
- Trying the tool **without Docker or complex deployment**

While exploring GitHub, I found many impressive “Open Notebook” projects.
They are powerful and well-designed — but almost all of them rely on Docker.
For beginners and non-backend users, that alone can be a deal-breaker.

So I built **KnowNote**:  
a simple Electron-based desktop app that brings NotebookLM-style workflows
to a **local-first, Docker-free environment**.

This is my **first open-source project**.  
It’s still early, but the core idea works — and I’m excited to share it and learn from the community.

## What KnowNote does (so far)

- 📚 Build a local knowledge base from documents and notes
- 💬 Chat, summarize, and reason with your content using LLMs
- 🔌 Provider-based LLM design (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, and more)
- 🔍 RAG-powered retrieval with precise source traceability
- 🖥️ Desktop app built with Electron — no Docker, no server setup

---

## Who is this for?

KnowNote is for you if:

- You like NotebookLM but want more control
- You prefer using private or self-hosted LLM APIs
- You don’t want to spin up Docker just to try an idea
- You want a simple desktop app for learning and research
